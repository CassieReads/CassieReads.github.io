                Michelle L. Teichmanâ€™s <i>The Space Between<i> was the last book I read in 2019. Aside from it being the last book I read for the year, it is also one of my favorites. 
This book tells the story of two teenage girls coming to terms with their sexuality. 
Harper is popular, while Sarah is an outcast. The unlikely pair develop a friendship and, eventually, a relationship. Sarah comes from a religious family wherein her father is a preacher, which is reminiscent of another book I read recently, <i>Dress Codes for Small Towns<i> by Courtney Stevens (another book I would highly recommend). 
Together, Harper and Sarah navigate love and coming out. The entire book is breathtakingly beautiful. My favorite part of the novel is the Epilogue because of how perfectly it wraps up the story. 
This is a book that young adults need to read, especially those who are struggling with their own sexuality. Reading this as a 21-year-old who only recently came out as a lesbian, I can certainly say that I would have greatly benefited from a book like this when I was in middle school and/or high school.
